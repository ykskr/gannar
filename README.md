This is currently just a partial copy of gannar (http://cgi28.plala.or.jp/ssdi/gannar/gannar.cgi).

## HOW TO START

Set option variables, especially '$adminpass' variable.
Then run gannar.cgi from a browser with '?mode=admin' query string to enter admin page.
Input password you set in the '$adminpass', and press reset button.
You can now send your gannar page to public to entry your game.
Notice that that next game will be postponed unless you stock a map from admin page.

## REGISTER MAP

The map texts will be obtained from URI below.
These map texts contain return code, which you must delete when you stock a map.

## NOTE

Any fix, customize, modification, etc. are appreciated.
There is no ploblem if it's totally different from original.

I'm not sure these English are correct. You can fix this file too.
